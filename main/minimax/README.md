# Minimax algorithm

This algorithm tries to maximize my score, while taking into accout that 
you will do your best to minimize my score.

## Dummy implementation

We will implement the minimax algorithm over a tree.
The tree will have nodes that branch out, and it will have 
leafs with fixed values.
