## Recursion - Practical applications

Tower of Hanoi  
A puzzle involving a tower of `stacked disks`                       p54  
Solve the puzzle yourself, in `interactive` mode.                   p54  

Flood Fill  
Begins on one pixel and `spreads` until it meets a non-white.       p60  

Tree Traversal  
We can write code to `access any node` by starting from root node.  p73  

Maze solve    
A perfect maze has exactly `one path` from start to exit.           p83  

Fractals
Fractals are shapes that `repeat themselves`, sometimes chaotically.  p175
They include many natural and artificial shapes.
