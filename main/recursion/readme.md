## Algorithms - Recursion

Call Stacks  
Programming languages remember `which line` called the function.    p05  
To really understand recursion, you must first `understand stacks`  p06  
The program's call stack is a stack of `frame objects`              p09  
The limit of stack size is `1000 function calls` in Python.         p13  

Base case   
To avoid `a crash` there must be a base case.                       p14  
Reaching the base case `doesn't means` the end of program.          p15  

Recursion vs Iteration  
For calculating `factorials` the iterative approach is better.      p22  
The recursive approach will take `fibonacci(100)` million years.    p25  

Exponents  
Exponents are calculated by `multiplying` a number by itself.       p34  
Iterative function based on `power rule` from recursive approach.   p36   

Tower of Hanoi  
A puzzle involving a tower of `stacked disks`                       p54  
Solve the puzzle yourself, in `interactive` mode.                   p54  

Flood Fill
Begins on one pixel and `spreads` until it meets a non-white.       p60  

Tree Traversal  
We can write code to `access any node` by starting from root node.  p73  

Maze solve    
A perfect maze has exactly `one path` from start to exit.           p83
