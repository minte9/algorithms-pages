## Recursion

### Call Stacks  
> Programming languages remember `which line` called the function.    p05  
To really understand recursion, you must first `understand stacks`  p06  
The program's call stack is a stack of `frame objects`              p09  
The limit of stack size is `1000 function calls` in Python.         p13  

### Base case   
> To avoid `a crash` there must be a base case.                       p14  
Reaching the base case `doesn't means` the end of program.          p15  

### Recursion vs Iteration  
> For calculating `factorials` the iterative approach is better.      p22  
The recursive approach will take `fibonacci(100)` million years.    p25  

### Exponents  
> Exponents are calculated by `multiplying` a number by itself.       p34  
Iterative function based on `power rule` from recursive approach.   p36   

### Memoization
> Memoization is a technique of `remembering` the return values. p151  
Memoize means `to store` (the result of computed expression).
