# Memoization - Algorithms

Memoization is a technique of `remembering` the return values. p151
Memoize means `to store` (the result of computed expression).

Dinamic programming is a technique that breaks a large problem into 
`overlaping subproblems`.

Not all functions can be memoized.
In `functional programming` we write functions that don't modify 
global variables or any external state.

The python sqrt() function is `deterministic` (always return the same value).
Tgen time.time() function is `nondeterministic`.

Side `effects` are any changes that a function makes to anything outside its code.
If a function is deterministic and as no side effects, it is called `pure function`.
