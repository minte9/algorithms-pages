#### Call Stacks
  [p05](./01_call_stacks/line_remembering.py) 
Programming languages remember `which line` called the function.  
  [p06](./01_call_stacks/lifo_lists.py) 
To really understand recursion, you must first `understand stacks`  
  [p09](./01_call_stacks/frame_objects.py) 
The program's call stack is a stack of `frame objects`  
  [p13](./01_call_stacks/stack_overflow.py) 
The limit of stack size is `1000 function calls` in Python.  


#### Base case 
  [p14](./02_base_case/base_case.py) 
To avoid `a crash` there must be a base case.  
  [p15](./02_base_case/before_after.py) 
Reaching the base case `doesn't means` the end of program.   


#### Iterative approach
  [p22](./03_iterative_approach/factorial_number.py) 
For calculating `factorials` the iterative approach is better.  
  [p25](./03_iterative_approach/fibonacci_sequence.py) 
The recursive approach will take `fibonacci(100)` million years to complete.  


#### Exponents
  [p34](./04_exponents/calculating_exponents.py) 
Exponents are calculated by `multiplying` a number by itself.  
  [p36](./04_exponents/recursive_insights.py) 
Iterative function based on `power rule` from recursive approach.  

##

#### Head Tail
  [p46](./05_head_tail/sum_numbers.py) 
To sum numbers we `add the head` to the sum of tail array.  
  [p49](./05_head_tail/reverse_strings.py) 
To reverse a string we `place the head behind` the tail.  


#### Middle
  [p52](./06_palindrome/palindrome.py) 
A palindrome is a word or phrase `spelled the same` forward or backword.


#### Tower of Hanoi
  [p54](./07_tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi.py) 
A puzzle involving a tower of `stacked disks`  
  [p54](./07_tower_of_hanoi/tower_of_hanoi2_play.py) 
Solve the puzzle yourself, in `interactive` mode.


#### Flood Fill
  [p60](./08_flood_fill/flood_fill.py) 
Begins on one pixel and `spreads` until it meets a non-white pixel.  


#### Tree Traversal
  [p73](./09_tree_traversal/tree_traversal.py) 
We can write code to `access any node` by starting from root node.
