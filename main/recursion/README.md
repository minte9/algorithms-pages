## Call Stacks
  [p05](./call_stacks/line_remembering.py) 
The programs remember `which line` of code called the function.  
  [p06](./call_stacks/lifo_lists.py) 
To really understand recursion, you must first `understand stacks`  
  [p09](./call_stacks/frame_objects.py) 
The program's call stack is a stack of `frame objects`  
  [p13](./call_stacks/stack_overflow.py) 
The limit of stack size is `1000 function calls` in Python.  

## Base case 
  [p13](./base_case/base_case.py) 
To avoid `a crash` there must be a base case.  
  [p14](./base_case/recursive_case.py) 
Reaching the base case `doesn't means` the end of program.   

## Iterative approach
  [p22](./iterative_approach/factorial.py) 
For calculating `factorials` the iterative approach is better.  
  [p25](./iterative_approach/fibonacci_sequence.py) 
The recursive approach will take `fibonacci(100)` million years to complete.  

## Exponents
  [p34](./exponents/calculating_exponents.py) 
Exponents are calculated by `multiplying` a number by itself.  
  [p36](./exponents/recursive_insights.py) 
Iterative function based on `power rule` from recursive approach.  

## Head Tail
  [p46](./head_tail/sum_numbers.py) 
We add the head to the sum of tail array.  
  [p49](./head_tail/reverse_string.py) .py) 
To reverse a string we need to place the `head behind` the tail.  

## Palindrome
  pp52
Word or phrase spelled the same forward or backword.

#-- palindrome.py --#

<br/>



## Tower of Hanoi
  pp54
A puzzle involving a tower of stacked disks.

#-- tower_of_hanoi.py --#

### Interactive 

Solve the puzzle yourself, in interactive mode.

#-- tower_of_hanoy2_play.py --#

<br/>



## Flood Fill
  pp60
Begins on one pixel and spreads until it meets a non-white pixel.

#-- flood_fill.py --#

<br/>



## Ackermann Function
  pp64
Known of being an example of highly recursive function.

#-- ackermann_function --#

<br/>
