Concept:
- Computer scienties have borrowed the concept from mathematics.
- Big-O is focusing on the number of steps, but in a specific way.

Key idea:
- We focus on how fast steps grow, not exact counts
- Constants and small differences are ignored

Big-O answers the question:
- What happens to performance when the input becomes VERY large?
