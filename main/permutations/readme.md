# Permutations

> Sets
A set is a collection of `unique objects` {A,B,C}. p124  
Order `doesn't matter` for a set, {A,B,C} is the same as {B,A,C}  
A set like {A,B,C,A} has repeate A and so is `not a set`.  

> Permutations
A permutation of a set is a `specific ordering` of all elements. p127  
For example {A,B,C} has `six` permutations.  
ABC ACB BAC BCA CAB CBA  

> Combinations
A combination is a `selection of elements` from a set. p134  
We say a `k-combination` is a subset of k elements for a set.  
The 1-combinations of {A,B,C} are: {A}, {B}, {C}  
The 2-combinations of {A,B,C} are: {A,B}, {A,C}, {B,C}  
The 3-combinarions of {A,B,C} are: {A,B,C}  

The term `n choose k` refers to the number of possible combinations.  
For example 4 choose 2 is `6 combinations` without repetition.   
{A,B,C,D} -> {A,B} {A,C} {A,D} {B,C} {B,D} {C,D}  

The `formula` for calculating n choose k is:  
C(n,k) = (n!) / (k! x (n-k)!)
