## Divide Conquer

### Binary search      
> We repeatedly determining `which half` of the list the item is in. p93  

### Quicksort    
> Uses a divide-concuer technique called `partitioning` p96  

### Merge Sort    
> Each recusive call `divides` the unsorted list into halves. p104  

### Sum numbers  
> We can divide a large array of numbers into `smaller arrays` to sum. p110  

### Karatsuba multiplication  
> Fast multiplication algorithm, developed by `Anatoly` Karatsuba. p13
